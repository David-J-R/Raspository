abstract = {The matrix-completion problem has attracted a lot of attention, largely as a result of the celebrated Netflix competition. Two popular approaches for solving the problem are nuclear-norm-regularized matrix approximation (Candes and Tao, 2009, Mazumder, Hastie and Tibshirani, 2010), and maximum-margin matrix factorization (Srebro, Rennie and Jaakkola, 2005). These two procedures are in some cases solving equivalent problems, but with quite different algorithms. In this article we bring the two approaches together, leading to an efficient algorithm for large matrix factorization and completion that outperforms both of these. We develop a software package "softImpute" in R for implementing our approaches, and a distributed version for very large matrices using the "Spark" cluster programming environment.},

@article{Akulenko2016,
abstract = {Batch effects describe non-natural variations of, for example, large-scale genomic data sets. If not corrected by suitable numerical algorithms, batch effects may seriously affect the analysis of these datasets. The novel array platform independent software tool BEclear enables researchers to identify those portions of the data that deviate statistically significant from the remaining data and to replace these portions by typical values reconstructed from neighboring data entries based on latent factor models. In contrast to other comparable methods that often use some sort of global normalization of the data, BEclear avoids changing the apparently unaffected parts of the data. We tested the performance of this approach on DNA methylation data for various tumor data sets taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas and compared the results to those obtained with the existing algorithms ComBat, Surrogate Variable Analysis, RUVm and Functional normalization. BEclear constantly performed at par with or better than these methods. BEclear is available as an R package at the Bioconductor project http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BEclear.html.},

@article{Dimitrakopoulos2018,
abstract = {Motivation: Several molecular events are known to be cancer-related, including genomic aberrations , hypermethylation of gene promoter regions and differential expression of microRNAs. These aberration events are very heterogeneous across tumors and it is poorly understood how they affect the molecular makeup of the cell, including the transcriptome and proteome. Protein interaction networks can help decode the functional relationship between aberration events and changes in gene and protein expression. Results: We developed NetICS (Network-based Integration of Multi-omics Data), a new graph diffusion-based method for prioritizing cancer genes by integrating diverse molecular data types on a directed functional interaction network. NetICS prioritizes genes by their mediator effect, defined as the proximity of the gene to upstream aberration events and to downstream differentially expressed genes and proteins in an interaction network. Genes are prioritized for individual samples separately and integrated using a robust rank aggregation technique. NetICS provides a comprehensive computational framework that can aid in explaining the heterogeneity of aberration events by their functional convergence to common differentially expressed genes and proteins. We demonstrate NetICS' competitive performance in predicting known cancer genes and in generating robust gene lists using TCGA data from five cancer types. Availability and implementation: NetICS is available at https://github.com/cbg-ethz/netics.},
